    <h1>Fuld v. PLO</h1>
    <h2>Global Impact of Landmark Ruling on Terror Accountability</h2>
    <p><strong>By Koos Pretorius | June 26, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>In a unanimous and groundbreaking ruling on June 20, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court held in <strong>Fuld v. Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)</strong> that American victims of overseas terrorist attacks can sue the PLO and the Palestinian Authority (PA) in U.S. courts. The decision was based on the <strong>Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act</strong> (PSJVTA), enacted by Congress in 2020.</p>

    <p>This landmark decision is expected to have far-reaching implications, not only for the families of terror victims but also for U.S. foreign relations, sovereign immunity doctrine, and international law.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>The Case of Ari Fuld</h3>
    <p>The case centers on the 2018 killing of Ari Fuld, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who was stabbed to death by a Palestinian teenager in the West Bank. Fuld’s family alleged the attack was part of a broader policy by the PA to incite violence and reward perpetrators through financial incentives—known as the “pay-for-slay” program.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Legal Framework</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1992:</strong> Allows U.S. nationals to seek damages for acts of international terrorism.</li>
      <li><strong>Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA) of 2020:</strong> Asserts jurisdiction over foreign entities that receive U.S. aid or operate in the U.S.</li>
      <li><strong>Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA):</strong> The PLO and PA were denied sovereign immunity because they are not recognized as states.</li>
      <li><strong>Sokolow v. PLO (2016):</strong> A precedent where a $655 million award was overturned due to lack of jurisdiction, prompting the passage of PSJVTA.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h3>The Supreme Court Ruling</h3>
    <p>The Court held that the PLO and PA are not protected by sovereign immunity, and the PSJVTA constitutionally extends jurisdiction. Chief Justice Roberts wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Congress acted within its authority to provide a forum for American victims of international terrorism. To deny jurisdiction here would be to ignore the deliberate and continuing relationship between the defendants and the United States.”
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>Expert Views</h3>
    <blockquote>
      “This case represents a seismic shift in transnational tort law. It blurs the line between criminal prosecution and civil liability, especially where foreign policy intersects with personal justice.” — <strong>Prof. Rachel Levine</strong>, Georgetown
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>The Victims’ Perspective</h3>
    <blockquote>
      “This ruling is a victory not just for Ari, but for every American citizen who’s ever felt abandoned after a terror attack abroad. Justice doesn’t stop at the water’s edge.” — <strong>Eytan Fuld</strong>, brother of Ari Fuld
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>Political and Diplomatic Fallout</h3>
    <p>The Palestinian Authority condemned the ruling as “a dangerous violation of Palestinian sovereignty.” Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department called for restraint and reaffirmed its commitment to peace and dialogue in the region.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
    <p>Legal experts expect a wave of new lawsuits. Even if plaintiffs win judgments, enforcement will likely require complex asset tracing and legal coordination. Congress may also face pressure to strengthen the PSJVTA or pass additional measures.</p>
